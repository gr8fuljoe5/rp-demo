"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev", //  Runs next dev which starts Next.js in development mode

}
```

# The Basics

- Routing (Basic, Dynamic, API)
- Built in CSS Support
- Image Optimization


---
# Data Fetching
- Client-Side Rendering (CSR)
- Server-side Rendering (SSR)
- Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Incremental Static Regeneration (ICR)

___
# Server Side Rendering (SSR)
- Each HTML page is generated per request
- Next allows the first page load to be rendered by the server 
  - Great for SEO and performance
  - No need to rebuild when content changes
  
``` 
getServerSideProps() - Next will pre-render the page on each request
```

---
# Static Site Generation (SSG)

- Fetches data at build time
- Can specify dynamic routes to pre-render pages based on data. 
- Newspaper stand

```
getStaticProps() - use when your page content depends on extendal data
getStaticPaths() - used when your paths depend on external data (usually used in addition to getStaticProps) 
```
___
# Incremental Static Regeneration (ICR)
With `getStaticProps` you don't have to stop relying on dynamic content, as static content can also be dynamic. Incremental Static Regeneration allows you to update existing pages by re-rendering them in the background as traffic comes in.

___
# Dynamic Imports
Next.js supports ES2020 `dynamic import()` for JavaScript. With it, you can import JavaScript modules dynamically and work with them. They also work with SSR.
