## What is Next.js

Next.js is an open-source React front-end development web framework created by Vercel. 

It's two biggest features are:

# Server Side Rendering (SSR)
- Traditional React apps are loaded and rendered entirely on the client
- Next allows the first page load to be rendered by the server 
  - Great for SEO and performance

- Fetches data at build time
